# Pet Rescue Port
The goal of Pet Rescue Port is to be an open source solution for animal shelters to manage and maintain different aspects of their day to day operations.

* Maintain a database of information on each animal in the shelter with an admin dashboard to interface with it.
* Host an adoption gallery web app for displaying which animals are available for adoption, searching them, and finding info about them.
* Take in applications for adoptions and volunteers.
* Host a landing page for the animal shelter site.

Why specifically do I care? I just kind of want a side project to try and undertake designing a complete system from the ground up.
